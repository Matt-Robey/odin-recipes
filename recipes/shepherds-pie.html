  <h1>Shepherd's Pie</h1>

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Shepherd's pie is a savory dish of cooked minced meat topped with cheese mashed potatoes and baked. Traditionally the meat used is mutton, although lamb or even beef may be used instead. Along with the meat, a mix of vegetables may be included as well. These are typically onions, peas, carrots, and sometimes corn.</p>
  <p>When I make this dish, I sometimes use ground turkey instead of red meat, and use whatever vegetables I happen to have on hand. I've added mushrooms, brocolli, and cauliflour and have always been satisfied with the final product.</p>
