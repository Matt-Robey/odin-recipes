  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Perfect for pasta, lasagna, eggplant parmesan, or any other tomato sauce need, this simple recipe can be adjusted as needed. I've added ground meat, sausage, cheese, and other vegetables to this sauce to have it match my needs. Most of the time involved in cooking this involves allowing it to simmer, so it doesn't take too long to prepeare this either. Adding the greated carrot allows some sweetness to come through without needing to add sugar or cream.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 can whole peeled tomatoes (unsalted if possible)</li>
    <li>1/2 - 1 small yellow onion (chopped)</li>
    <li>1/2 carrot (finely grated)</li>
    <li>2-3 cloves of garlic (minced)</li>
    <li>1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves (minced)</li>
    <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>1 tsp tomato paste</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
